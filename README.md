corrmorant: Flexible Correlation Matrices Based on ggplot2
================
Roman M. Link

Description
-----------

`corrmorant` extends `ggplot2` by an automated framework for plots of correlation matrices that can be easily modified via regular `ggplot2` syntax. In addition, a large set of visualization tools for exploratory data analysis based on correlation matrices is provided.

**Please note that this project is a work in progress!** I have just begun moving the project to this repository and converting it to a regular R package architecture, so expect lots of changes in the next weeks until I finish a workable version.
