stat_heatcircle(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  geom = "ribbon",
  position = "identity",
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \link[ggplot2:aes]{aes} that
are passed on to subsequent layers. \code{x} and \code{y} are set automatically and
must not be changed,  but all other aesthetics may be manipulated. Defaults
to \code{NULL} (use standard \code{ggcorrm} mapping).}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use display the data}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{corr_method}{character string with the correlation method passed to
\link[=stats]{cor()}. Can be one of \code{"pearson"}, \code{"kendall"} and \code{"spearman"}.
Defaults to \code{"pearson"} (or is inherited from the setting in \code{\link[=ggcorrm]{ggcorrm()}}).}

\item{rmin}{numeric (0 - 1). Minimum radius for the "heat circles" (as a
proportion of panel width). Defaults to 0.1.}

\item{rmax}{numeric (0 - 1). Maximum radius for the "heat circles" (as a
proportion of panel width). Defaults to 0.9.}

\item{scale_by}{character.  \code{scale_by = "area"} scales the area of the
circles by correlation strength, \code{scale_by = "radius"} scales by radius.
Defaults to "area".}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{ggplot2::layer()}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{Layer}.
}
\description{
\code{stat_heatcircle()} is used to compute bivariate correlations
and display them in \link{ggcorrm} plots in form of circles whose color and size
indicate correlation strength.
}
\details{
\code{stat_heatcircle()} computes the outlines of circles that are
centered around the midpoint of \code{gcorrm} facets and whose radius or area is
modified in dependence of correlation strength. \code{rmin} and \code{rmax} allow to
modify the range in which the radii of the circles may vary. The circles
are displayed using \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_ribbon]{ggplot2::geom_ribbon()}}.
