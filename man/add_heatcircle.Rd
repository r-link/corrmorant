\title{Add circles whose size represents correlation strength}
\usage{
lotri_heatcircle(
  mapping = NULL,
  corr_method = "pearson",
  rmin = 0.1,
  rmax = 0.9,
  scale_by = c("area", "radius"),
  ...
)

utri_heatcircle(
  mapping = NULL,
  corr_method = "pearson",
  rmin = 0.1,
  rmax = 0.9,
  scale_by = c("area", "radius"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}.
x and y are set automatically and must not bechanged, but all other
aesthetics may be manipulated. By default, the \code{fill} aesthetic is mapped
to \code{..corr..} internally (color by correlation strength), but this is
overridden when explicitly specified. Defaults to \code{NULL} (use standard
settings).}

\item{corr_method}{character string with the correlation method passed
to \link[=stats]{cor()}. Can be one of \code{"pearson"}, \code{"kendall"} and
\code{"spearman"}. Defaults to \code{"pearson"} (or is inherited from the setting
in \code{\link[=ggcorrm]{ggcorrm()}}).}

\item{rmin}{numeric (0 - 1). Minimum radius for the "heat circles" (as a
proportion of panel width). Defaults to 0.1.}

\item{rmax}{numeric (0 - 1). Maximum radius for the "heat circles" (as a
proportion of panel width). Defaults to 0.9.}

\item{scale_by}{character.  \code{scale_by = "area"} scales the area of the
circles by correlation strength, \code{scale_by = "radius"} scales by
radius. Defaults to "area".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \link{stat_heatcircle}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} layer with circles displaying correlation strength.
}
\description{
\code{lotri_heatcircle()} and \code{utri_heatcircle()} are used
to display circles whose fill and size aesthetics depend on correlation
strength in the lower/upper off-diagonal facets of \link{ggcorrm} plots.
}
\details{
\code{lotri_heatcircle()} and \code{utri_heatcircle()} are wrappers
around \code{\link[=stat_heatcircle]{stat_heatcircle()}} that additionally
take care of the right specification of aesthetics.

\code{stat_heatcircle()} computes the outlines of circles that
are centered around the midpoint of \code{ggcorrm} facets and whose radius
or area is modified in dependence of correlation strength. \code{rmin} and
\code{rmax} allow to modify the range in which the radii of the circles may
vary. By standard, the \code{fill} aesthetic is mapped to \code{.corr}, but this
can be overridden by specifying a different mapping.
