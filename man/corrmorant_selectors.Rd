\usage{
lotri(layer)

utri(layer)

dia(layer)
}
\arguments{
\item{layer}{A \code{ggplot} layer (created by a call to a geom or a stat, or to
the \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{ggplot2::layer()}}).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 \link[ggplot2:layer]{layer} with modified data.
}
\description{
Selector functions that can be used to modify the mapping of
\code{ggplot} \link[ggplot2:layer]{layers} to a subset of panels in \code{ggcorrm} plots.
}
\details{
The corrmorant selector functions \code{lotri()}, \code{utri()} and \code{dia()}
modify the data slot of \code{ggplot} layers (invoked by a call to a geom, a
stat or \link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}) to make sure that they are only displayed
in the desired panels of \code{ggcorrm} plot.

\code{lotri()} shows the layer only in panels of the lower triangle, \code{utri()} in
the upper triangle and \code{dia()} in the panels of the plot diagonal.

If no data are specified explicitly in the layer, the selectors filter the
data for the desired panels from the \link{tidy_corrm} data the plot is based
upon. If data are specified in \code{layer} via its \code{data} argument, it either
plots it to all upper/lower triangle or diagonal panels (depending on the
type of selector) or matches it to the desired rows/columns if any
variables named \code{var_x}, \code{var_y} and/or \code{pos} are present in the new
dataset.

The combination of \code{lotri()} and \code{utri()} in combination with  regular
ggplot2 geoms should be sufficient for the a large number of use cases for
data displa in the lower and upper triangle of a correlation plot. However,
\code{dia()} in combination with regular geoms is often problematic for useful
displays on the diagonal facets, as they are often reserved for data
summaries that are difficult to place correctly in the facets when the data
have different ranges. A series of common data summaries for the plot
diagonal are provided with the functions \link{dia_names}, \link{dia_density},
\link{dia_histogram} and \link{dia_freqpoly}, which automatically take care of the
correct placement.

In addition, there are plenty of stats specifically designed for the use in
offdiagonal corrmorant facets that all exist in two versions, e.g.
\link{lotri_corrtext} and  \link{utri_corrtext}.
