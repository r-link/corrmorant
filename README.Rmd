## Description
`corrmorant` extends `ggplot2` by an automated framework for plots of correlation matrices that can be easily modified via regular `ggplot2` syntax. In addition, it provides a large set of visualization tools for exploratory data analysis based on correlation matrices.

| Please note that this project is a work in progress!                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This package is in steady development. Whenever I have time, I add or change some features. A somewhat stable version should not be too far away - look out for announcements over here. I will then begin with a regular versioning process. Until the package reaches this stage, please note that features may change or disappear without further notice. |

**Update 2020-07-07:** As of today, the `corrmorant` package will replace all uses of the `iris` dataset with the `drosera` dataset, which contains a set of (eugenics-free) biometric measurements of three African sundew species and is [available as a separate data-package](https://github.com/r-link/drosera).

**Update 2020-04-28:** So far, the package seems to work fine with R. v. 4.0.0. Keep me informed if you notice any unwanted behavior.

**Update 2020-03-06:** The package passes all tests with the newest `ggplot2`version (v. 3.3.0), but I haven't been able to check more thoroughly. I you notice any strange behavior with the new version, please let me know!


A big thank you goes out to the developers of the software without which this package would not be possible, especially [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/) and the rest of the [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) development team for their incredible work.

## Installation
The package can be installed from Github using `remotes::install_github()`:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install remotes package if necessary
install.packages("remotes")
# install corrmorant from the github repository
remotes::install_github("r-link/corrmorant")
```

Afterwards, the package can be loaded regularly via `library()`:
``` {r}
library(corrmorant)
```


## Simple plots with corrmorant()
The `corrmorant()` function is a simple wrapper function around the more complex `gcorrm()` function that can be used to create first, simple plots of correlation matrices for initial data inspection. Currently, three different styles are available, "light", "dark" and the default, "blue_red":

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# correlation plot of the drosera data using style = 'light'
corrmorant(drosera, style = "light")
# the "dark" style has a dark background in the diagonal facets
corrmorant(drosera, style = "dark")
# in the "blue_red" style, colors and correlation labels are colored by the strength of
# correlation
corrmorant(drosera, style = "blue_red")
```

``` {r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 4}
c1 <- corrmorant(drosera, style = "light")
c2 <- corrmorant(drosera, style = "dark")
c3 <- corrmorant(drosera, style = "blue_red")
cowplot::plot_grid(c1,c2,c3 + theme(legend.position = "none"), 
                   cowplot::get_legend(c3), nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(1,1,1,0.3))
```
It obvious that this illustration is not optimal because the three different _Drosera_ species have remarkably different leaf morphologies. More complex plots (e.g. with different correlations for different groups) are possible with `ggcorrm()`.  

## Basic usage of ggcorrm()
While `corrmorant()` may be useful for many basic data inspection tasks, its functionality is rather limited. If you want to take control of the elements in a plot, you can use `ggcorrm()` together with the corrmorant selector functions `lotri()`, `utri()` and `dia()` that direct ggplot layers to the lower or upper triangle or the plot diagonal of a `ggcorrm()` plot, respectively. In addition, corrmorant offers a series of utility functions for readymade data summaries on the plot diagonal (`dia_names()`, `dia_density()`, `dia_histogram` and `dia_freqpoly()`) as well as a couple of new stats, e.g. `stat_corrtext()` for displaying correlation strength in correlation plot facets. The new `corrmorant` stats can generally be called in a simplified form by prefixing their name with `lotri_` or `utri_`, e.g. `lotri_corrtext()` and `utri_corrtext()`

For example, `corrmorant(drosera, style = "light")` can be recreated by the following code:

```{r, message=FALSE}
p1 <- ggcorrm(drosera) +
  lotri(geom_point(alpha = 0.5)) +
  utri_corrtext() +
  dia_names(y_pos = 0.1, size = 3) +
  dia_density(lower = 0.4, fill = "grey80", color = 1)
p1
```

If you want, you can add additional ggplot2 layers, using the appropriate corrmorant selectors to restrict them to the appropriate set of facets. For example, you might want to display a linear trend in the facets on the lower triangle:

```{r}
p1 + lotri(geom_smooth(method = "lm"))
```

The horrific fit of these linear regressions results from the fact that the `drosera` dataset contains data from three different sundew species. You might want to include this information into your plot by plotting the three species in different colours, which can easily be achieved by setting plot level aesthetics using the `mapping` argument of `ggcorrm()`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggcorrm(drosera, mapping = aes(col = species, fill = species)) +
  lotri(geom_smooth(method = "lm")) +
  lotri(geom_point(alpha = 0.5)) +
  utri_corrtext(nrow = 2, squeeze = 0.6) +
  dia_names(y_pos = 0.1, size = 3) +
  dia_density(lower = 0.4, color = 1)
```

## Coloring data by correlation strength
To color a dataset by correlation strength, you can use the `.corr` column internally created in `tidy_corrm()` together with `scale_colour_corr()` or `scale_fill_corr()`:

```{r}
# simulate some data from a multivariate normal distribution
# (mtcars is only used as a shortcut to a positive definite covariance matrix)
data1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(100, colMeans(mtcars),  cov(mtcars))[, 1:8]
colnames(data1) <- paste("Var.", 1:ncol(data1))

# create plot
ggcorrm(data1, 
        mapping = aes(col = .corr, fill = .corr),
        bg_dia = "grey20") +
  lotri(geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = .3)) +
  lotri(geom_point(alpha = 0.5)) +
  utri_corrtext(nrow = 2, squeeze = 0.6) +
  dia_names(y_pos = 0.1, size = 3, color = "white") +
  dia_histogram(lower = 0.4, color = "grey80", fill = "grey60", size = .3) +
  scale_color_corr(aesthetics = c("fill", "color"))
```

## Correlation heatmaps and more 
`corrmorant` offers a series of new geoms and stats that are designed to improve the display of correlation strength.

For example, there is a set of stats for correlation heatmaps and the likes, which can be useful when inspecting datasets with large numbers of variables:

```{r}
select(mtcars, mpg, disp:qsec) %>% 
ggcorrm() +
  utri_heatmap(alpha = 0.5) +
  lotri_heatcircle(alpha = 0.5, col = 1) +
  utri_corrtext() +
  dia_names(y_pos = 0.1, size = 3) +
  dia_density(lower = 0.4, fill = "lightgrey", color = 1) +
  scale_fill_corr() 
```


With `lotri_/utri_heatpoint()`, you can scale the diameter of any character you want by correlation strength.
And yes, your right, this means you can display correlation strength with purple skulls and angry cat faces:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
airquality %>% 
ggcorrm(aes(col = .corr)) +
  lotri_heatpoint(pch = "\U1F63E") +
  utri_heatpoint(pch = "\U2620", col = "#660066") +
  dia_names(y_pos = 0.1, size = 3) +
  dia_density(lower = 0.4, fill = "#89DFA3", color = 1) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 15)) + 
  scale_color_corr(option = "C")
```


## Print output of arbitrary functions of the data
If you want to place text labels for the output of arbitrary functions in your plots, you can use `lotri/utri_funtext()`, which uses the same placement rules as `stat_corrtext()`.

For instance, you could add lables for the slope of the linear models in the lower triangle (note how y and x are swapped to account for the reverse axes in the upper triangle).

```{r, message=FALSE}
# function to compute linear model slopes
lmslope <- function(x, y)  round(coef(lm(x ~ y))[2], 2)

# add slopes using a function
ggcorrm(drosera, mapping = aes(col = species, fill = species)) +
  lotri(geom_point(alpha = 0.4)) +
  lotri(geom_smooth(alpha = 0.4, method = "lm")) +
  utri_funtext(fun = lmslope, squeeze = .6) +
  dia_density(lower = .4, col = 1, alpha = 0.4) +
  dia_names(y_pos = .1)
```

Besides using a two-parameter formula, `stat_funtext()`, the stat underlying `lotri/utri_funtext()`, also accepts rlang style lambda expressions describing functions and quosures generated with `quo()` (referring to the variable names `x` and `y`).

Here are two ways to copy the output of `stat_corrtext()` - using a lambda expression (a formula containing `.x` and `.y`) in the upper and a quosure in the lower triangle:

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggcorrm(drosera, aes(col = .corr), rescale = "as_is") +
  utri_funtext(fun = ~ round(cor(.x, .y), 2)) +
  lotri_funtext(fun = quo(round(cor(x, y), 2))) +
  dia_names(y_pos = .5) +
  scale_color_corr()
```
